Your response goes here!
I really have not learned any new skills. I learned long ago that coding is the same regardless of the language, it is just a matter of syntax and structure differences. I have was plesantly surprised how easy it was to get back into the "headspace" for writing code, being able to "see" the results of the code I'm inputting even before refreshing the browser. The hard part thus far has been trying to determine what is still within the realm of HTML and what has been exported to CSS (e.g. elimination of the FONT tag in HTML). And I have absolutely used the problem solving strategies noted before. I use them every day, not just when sitting behind a keyboard. The same mindset can be applied to nearly all aspects in life.
